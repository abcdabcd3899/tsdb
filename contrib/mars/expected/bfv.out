-- BFV, bugfix verification
--
--
-- bfv: runtime keys were not evaluated in non-join prepared statements.
--
-- we used to believe that the runtime keys only occur in joining, so we only
-- evaluate the runtime keys in rescan, however it is also possible in prepared
-- statements, so mars see unevaluated runtime keys and generate empty results.
--
-- it is fixed by evaluating the runtime keys also in non-join statements.
--
-- note: to triggere the issue we has to execute the same prepared statement
-- multiple times, in the first several times the plan cache forces the
-- non-cached plan to be executed several times to evaulate the costs, after
-- this warm-up stage the cached plan gets the chance to be picked.
