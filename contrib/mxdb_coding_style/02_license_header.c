 *
 * NOTES
 *	  The first comment block before any code or `#include`, is called the
 *	  license header, just like this one.
 *
 *	  It contains several sections, from the top to bottom:
 *
 *	  - The short description;
 *	  - The copyright;
 *	  - The IDENTIFICATION: it is often omitted in Greenplum code;
 *	  - The NOTES: optional, something that needs special attention;
 *
 *	  Do not put everything in the license header:
 *
 *	  - The high-level design or the user guide should be put in a README file
 *	    under the same directory;
 *	  - The api doc should be put in the function headers;
 *	  - The implementation details should be documented in the code directory;
 *
